# BigMartSalesPrediction
## Overview
This repository contains code for predicting sales of BigMart stores using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and testing the models is provided by BigMart and contains various features such as item weight, item visibility, item type, outlet type, etc., which influence the sales of products.
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found in the data directory. It includes two CSV files:

train.csv: Contains the training data with features and corresponding sales values.
test.csv: Contains the test data with features; the sales values need to be predicted.
#### Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
##### Usage
Run the bigmart_sales_prediction.ipynb notebook.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the machine learning models and make predictions on the test data.
Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
Modify the notebook as needed for experimentation or improvement.
